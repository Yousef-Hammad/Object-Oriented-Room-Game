# Object-Oriented Room Game

This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version, it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms. The player can also pick up items along the way, eat cookies, drop items and much more.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.
